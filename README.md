Overlay Plugin for jQuery
=========================

This plugin is released under the BSD 3-clause license.

How do I use this thing?
------------------------

Quite easy actually, after settings up the CSS for your
overlay simply call `$('#your_overlay_element').overlay();`
when you want the overlay to be displayed.

See the `example.html` file for a better example.
